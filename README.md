My first python project, a memory game played on the console.
Its simple it uses if statements, for loops, lists of lists, random and time.

Up to 5 players, with 5 lifes each, after loosing all 5 lifes its next players turn, after all playeres loose all their lifes, game ends and prints a scoreboard
